    *  - has the list of triggers -> events that it should respond to (e.g. all errors)
    *  - should be bounded with specific view (root in which it should be displayed)
    *  - maybe distinct the event it should be closed to
    *  - the view should be customizable
    *  - try to create skeleton loader?
